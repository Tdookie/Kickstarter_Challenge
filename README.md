# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project 
In this spreadsheet we are performing an analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover any trends that can help Louise start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her new play. The estimated budget of this project is a little over $10,000. We will identify wheter there are any specific factors that make a project's campaign successful. This will help Louise gain a greater understanding of successful campaigns from start to finish. Next, we will set her campaign to mirror other lucrative campaigns in similar categories. 
### Analysis and Challenges
To begin this analysis we combed through the original kickstarter data set to discover if there are any immediate significant trends within previous successful theater kickstarters. We prepared this analysis by filtering the data to first look at successful and failed kickstarters focused on plays. Next, we looked at the goal amount and pledged amount to see if there was a symbolic relationship between the two to distinguish if the goal amount had a direct impact on the amount pledged, or if it has infuence on a kickstarter to be successful or not. We then looked at the outcomes of these kickstarters by launch date to see if that has an direct impact as well. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This analysis filtered the data set to focus on theater kickstarters and the outcomes based on their launchdate. It shows us eaach outcome from every month based on the years 2014-2016. This is very helpful for Louise because it shows her the total amount of kickstarters and the count of outcomes for every month over the years which is can be very crucial data if she wants to start her own kickstarter. We filtered our data and made a visual representation of the data on our data spreadsheet to allow Louise at a first glance gain a conclusion out of the filtered data.
