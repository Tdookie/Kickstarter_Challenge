# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project 
In this spreadsheet we are performing an analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover any trends that can help Louise start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her new play. The estimated budget of this project is a little over $10,000. We will identify wheter there are any specific factors that make a project's campaign successful. This will help Louise gain a greater understanding of successful campaigns from start to finish. Next, we will set her campaign to mirror other lucrative campaigns in similar categories. 
### Analysis and Challenges
To begin this analysis we combed through the original kickstarter data set to discover if there are any immediate significant trends within previous successful theater kickstarters. We prepared this analysis by filtering the data to first look at successful and failed kickstarters focused on plays. Next, we looked at the goal amount and pledged amount to see if there was a symbolic relationship between the two to distinguish if the goal amount had a direct impact on the amount pledged, or if it has infuence on a kickstarter to be successful or not. We then looked at the outcomes of these kickstarters by launch date to see if that has an direct impact as well. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This analysis filtered the data set to focus on theater kickstarters and the outcomes based on their launchdate. It shows us eaach outcome from every month based on the years 2014-2016. This is very helpful for Louise because it shows her the total amount of kickstarters and the count of outcomes for every month over the years which is can be very crucial data if she wants to start her own kickstarter. We filtered our data and made a visual representation of the data on our data spreadsheet to allow Louise at a first glance gain a conclusion out of the filtered data.

As shown in the chart above the data is constructed so that Louise can easily take a look at the data and quickly conclude when are the best and worst times of the year to launch a play kickstarter.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This data set focused on theater kickstarters and their outcomes based on their set goal amount. Within this data set and visual representation we can easily see that the more the set goal amount increases, the percentage of being successful decreases.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some challenges or difficulties encountered during this project was first identifying which data to structure first. In order to overcome this obstacle I continued to go through the modules and then I gained an understanding of which columns to filter and how to move futher within the project. I then had difficulty identifying which graph or chart to use to display the data and filter it in a way for readers to easily understand. I overcame this issue through trial and error and with the help of my peers. At first I was confused on how to filter graphs made from Pivot Tables so during our breakout room, my TA's and peers addressed this. I then made the graphs and began drafting different columns to multiple areas until I found one that displayed the best representation of what I wanted to display to readers and that aligned with the modules.
## Results
The Theater Outcomes By Launch Date data shows us the most successful and worst months during the year to Launch a theater kickstarter. In addition it shows the months in which successful or failed kickstarters spiked and dropped over the years. It also shows that their is no direct relationship between a launch date and the cancellation of a theater kickstarter. 
The outcomes based on goals data shows us a direction relationship with the goal amount and percentage that is deemed successful; As the goal amount increases in dollar amount the percentage of a kickstarter being successful decreases. 
One limitation of this data set are that they only collected data for 3 years on play kickstarters.
Another posible table/graph we could have created could have been an outcome based on deadline table/graph to discover if the deadline date had any impact on causing the kickstarter to become successful or fail. We also could have made a versus table between launch date and deadline to see if kickstarters that had a longer timeline were more successful than those that didn't.
